## [1.4.0] - 2026-01-13

### Fixed
- **December 2025 High Values Issue - Critical Data Integrity Fix**
  - Fixed double/triple counting from file format conversions (Watchdog script converts .xls to .xlsx and .csv)
  - Added file preference logic: process only .xlsx files when multiple formats exist (.xlsx > .csv > .xls)
  - Prevents processing same data multiple times from .xls source file and converted files
  - Removed 32,749 duplicate rows by eliminating .xls and .csv when .xlsx exists

- **Raw Time Off Data Deduplication**
  - Added deduplication with parsed dates/hours and normalized employee names
  - Improved matching by parsing dates and hours before deduplication
  - Removed 41,103 duplicate records from raw Time Off data (61,899 → 20,796 rows)
  - Ensures accurate usage calculations (Sick Time, SAT, Comp, Military, IOD)

- **Status Filtering for Usage Calculations**
  - Added approved-only filtering to raw Time Off data before usage metrics calculation
  - Removed 175 non-approved records from December 2025 usage totals
  - Ensures only approved transactions are counted in final metrics

### Changed
- **File Loading Logic**
  - Updated `load_folder()` to prefer .xlsx files over .csv and .xls for same base filename
  - Updated raw Time Off loading to use same file preference logic
  - Prevents duplicate processing when Watchdog script creates multiple file formats

- **Deduplication Strategy**
  - Main dataframe deduplication: Removed 61,222 duplicates (89,445 → 28,223 rows)
  - Raw Time Off deduplication: Removed 41,103 duplicates using parsed dates/hours
  - Deduplication now happens after parsing dates and hours for accurate matching

## [2025-12-11] - PowerBI_Date Migration to OneDrive

### Added
- **Migration verification script** (`verify_migration.ps1`)
  - Automated 8-point verification checklist
  - Validates config paths, directory structure, junctions, and script references
  - Provides detailed status report

- **Documentation**
  - `MIGRATION_VERIFICATION.md` - Comprehensive verification guide with manual check procedures
  - `VERIFICATION_SUMMARY.md` - Quick reference summary and testing steps
  - `CHANGELOG.md` - This file, for tracking all changes
  - `CURSOR_AI_PROMPT.md` - AI assistant prompt for workspace verification

### Changed
- **Configuration (`config\scripts.json`)**
  - Updated `powerbi_drop_path` from `C:\Dev\PowerBI_Date\_DropExports` to `C:\Users\carucci_r\OneDrive - City of Hackensack\PowerBI_Date\_DropExports`
  - Backup created: `config\scripts.json.bak`

- **Scripts**
  - `scripts\run_all_etl.ps1` - Updated next-step instructions with new PowerBI_Date path
  - Removed all references to old `C:\Dev\PowerBI_Date` paths

- **Documentation**
  - `README.md` - Updated with migration information, new directory structure, and recent updates section
  - `QUICK_START.md` - Updated all path references to new OneDrive location

### Fixed
- All path references updated to reflect OneDrive migration
- Script file path handling verified for OneDrive paths with spaces
- Documentation consistency across all files

### Infrastructure
- **Master_Automation Junction Created**
  - Location: `C:\Users\carucci_r\OneDrive - City of Hackensack\PowerBI_Date\Master_Automation`
  - Target: `C:\Users\carucci_r\OneDrive - City of Hackensack\Master_Automation`
  - Type: NTFS Junction (symlink)

### Verified
- ✅ Config file paths correct
- ✅ PowerBI_Date directory structure intact
- ✅ Master_Automation junction functional
- ✅ All script path references updated
- ✅ Documentation paths corrected
- ✅ Python executable accessible (Python 3.13.7)
- ✅ Drop folder accessible and writable

### Known Issues
- ⚠️ ETL script filenames may differ from `main.py` - verification needed
  - Action: Check actual script files and update `config\scripts.json` if needed
  - Common alternatives: `arrest_python_processor.py`, `process_*.py`, `run.py`

## [2025-12-09] - Initial Setup

### Added
- Initial Master_Automation workspace structure
- ETL orchestrator scripts (`run_all_etl.ps1`, `run_all_etl.bat`, `run_etl_script.ps1`)
- Configuration file (`config\scripts.json`)
- Basic documentation (`README.md`, `QUICK_START.md`)

### Features
- Sequential ETL script execution
- Error handling and logging
- Power BI output integration
- Selective script execution
- Status reporting

- All paths are now OneDrive-synced for cloud backup and multi-device access
- Junction link allows seamless access to Master_Automation from PowerBI_Date directory
- Verification script should be run after any configuration changes
- Logs directory is auto-created on first ETL run
